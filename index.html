        Well Look no further, revolutionary inventor, Pat, has found your solution. On it's way to be franchise wide, the inventor of the next delecacy tailored to both humans and fish. He's come up with the Salmon Cookie! Now we all know the million dollar question, if a fish can eat it, is it safe for us humans to eat it? OF COURSE IT IS! Pat spared no though when coming up with his invention, he took his love of coffee time sweets and his love for the ecosystem and combined the best of both worlds. Well at least the worlds involving humans and fish. Sorry bears, guess no cookies for you.

        Now while this company is still small, it is also very mighty. It's fast growing as people can't seem to get enough of the fact that there's a cookie that they can eat and even their favorite fish can eat too.
